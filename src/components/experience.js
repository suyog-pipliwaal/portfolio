								Worked on cross platform mobile application which convertâ€™s your phone into a mic. The app is available on android as well as apple play store by the name of Crowd Mics. 
								The main advantage of using this platform is audio delay which is less than 80 millisecond where as conventional system have delay of around 400 millisecond 
								in on same environment conditions. 
								This is possible because of our WebRTC module which is develop by our team. Majority of my work
								is towards user experience, adding new feature as required and bug fixing.
