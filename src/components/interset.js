					<p>
						Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time playing video games. Mostly on DOTA2 and Call of Duty Modern Warfare.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-0">
						When the Internet is not good for video games, I usually watch sci-fi shows on Black Hole and different experiments and theories related to them. 
						I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology advancements and different Software architecture deployed to make solutions scalable and efficient.
